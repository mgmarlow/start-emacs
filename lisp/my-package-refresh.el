;;; my-package-refresh.el --- Refresh package-archive-contents regularly   -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; The main purpose of this file is to demonstrate how to write lisp
;; "modules" that you can add to your Emacs configuration. Here we
;; define a module, `my-package-refresh.el', that helps keep your
;; package archives up to date. By default Emacs will only re-fetch
;; package information from the internet when
;; `package-refresh-contents' is manually invoked, whereas this code
;; will fetches every `my-package-automatic-refresh-threshold' hours
;; (default 7 days).
;;
;; Kudos to Andrey Listopadov for the original implementation:
;; https://andreyor.st/posts/2022-07-15-refresh-package-contents-automatically/
;;
;; Pro tip: "M-x auto-insert" fills in a bunch of the Emacs Lisp
;; boilerplate for you when defining new Emacs Lisp files.
